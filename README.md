# Branch
Branch is a project that was created for Oracle OpenWorld 2019. This project consisted of an admin and teacher dashboard, alongside a physical scaled-down version of a classroom. Using various software and hardware technologies, we created a smart classroom with various controls at your fingertips:
- Light Controls (dimming and color changing)
- Projector Controls (turning on and off the projector)
- Door Lock Controls (locking and unlocking the doors)
- Blinds Controls (moving blinds up and down)
- Multiple safety features in case of:
  * Lockdowns
  * Earthquakes
  * Fires
  * and more

This project took over a year to make and was created with the help of the Oracle Education Foundation.
